# **Melanoma Detection**

> This project focuses on the detection of melanoma from skin lesion images using deep learning techniques. By leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the goal is to build a model that can accurately predict whether a given lesion is malignant or benign.

## **General Information**
- **Background**: Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that is often associated with high mortality rates when detected late. Early detection plays a vital role in improving survival rates, making melanoma detection a critical application of machine learning in healthcare.

- **Business Problem**: This project addresses the challenge of diagnosing melanoma from skin lesions. By automating the detection process, the model helps healthcare professionals diagnose melanoma more accurately and promptly.

- **Dataset**: The project uses a dataset of dermoscopic images, specifically from the [ISIC (International Skin Imaging Collaboration)](https://www.isic-archive.com/) dataset. The dataset contains images labeled as benign or malignant, and the task is to classify the lesions based on these labels.

## **Conclusions**
- **Conclusion 1**: Preprocessing techniques such as image resizing and augmentation significantly improve the model's performance by diversifying the training data.

- **Conclusion 2**: A deep convolutional neural network (CNN) outperforms traditional machine learning models, providing a high level of accuracy in melanoma detection.

- **Conclusion 3**: The model achieves strong performance with high sensitivity and specificity, making it a reliable tool for early melanoma detection.

- **Conclusion 4**: Despite the promising results, the model still requires further optimization and validation on external datasets before it can be deployed in clinical settings.
